    I'm a front-end developer based in Lyon, France. Long time traveler, my parents moved around the world (Washington, Palo Alto, London, Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris and Annecy) and I have been used to discover new people, cultures and languages. I am devoted to create user-centered applications and to discover and learn as much as I can.
