description: Released in 2013 by Facebook, React is a Javascript Library for building
  user interfaces. People use React as the V of MVC which abstracts away the DOM from
  you, giving a simpler programming model and better performance. Facebook highlights
  React with 3 main concepts:<br/><ul class='n-categorie-description'><li><strong>Just
  the UI:</strong> Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. Since React makes no
  assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, it's easy to try it out on
  a small feature in an existing project.</li><li><strong>Virtual DOM:</strong> React
  abstracts away the DOM from you, giving a simpler programming model and better performance.
  React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using
  React Native.</li><li><strong>Data flow:</strong> React implements one-way reactive
  data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional
  data binding.</li></ul>
