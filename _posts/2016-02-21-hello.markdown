Hi, my name is Nicolas Thiry, I am a french student in Lyon at EPSI and I am currently completing a Master Degree in Computer Science. In addition I am working part time (2 days at school, 3 days at work) at Permigo, an online driving school.

This is my personal blog where I will share with you my experience as a front-end developer, but you can learn more about me on [my website](http://www.nicolasthy.com) (currently not available).

I do not pretend knowing everthing, this will be a place for me to share and get some feedback. You can get in touch with me by sending me [an email](mailto:n.thiry92@gmail.com) !

My english is a little bit rought, but I hope that these blogs will help me improve it ! Be gentle ! :)

Cheers.
