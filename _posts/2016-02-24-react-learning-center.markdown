_TLDR_: **ReactJS** is a Javascript library which is awesome ! [Here is a list of resources](#reactjs) you might want to check out !

Hi, as I said in my presentation post, I will be talking about my personal experiences as a front-end developer.

I have been learning and working on **ReactJS** projects for the past 6 months and I decided it was the time to start sharing my experience on this kind of new library that has been in spotlight for the past months. To be honest this is the first Javascript library that I've used other than jQuery so I was very excited to learn it.

ReactJS is explained as being the V in **MVC**. It's a powerful **Javascript** library that allows you to control the state of your application at any given time and interact with it so it refreshes only the changed parts. I started learning this library because we already had a complex app using Ruby On Rails and we didn't want to rewrite a full MVC app for the front-end. Therefor we only had to handle the view and retrieve the data from Rails. As I was learning what I needed to develop the components I needed for my work project, I ended up reading things about other libraries that work well with ReactJS such as **Flux, Redux, React-router, Socket.io, etc...** I then started to look how to implement these with or without Ruby On Rails. I finally realised that you could go way further than just the V of MVC and that you could easily create apps from scratch using ReactJS.

At this point I decided to learn as much as possible about ReactJS so that I could build any app with it. I love this library and try to start all my projects with it.

Learning ReactJS was pretty easy, there are tons of articles, tutorials, videos, etc... online. It's hard not to find something. However there are too many of them, therefor I will keep this article up to date for all of you looking for the right articles to learn React. This is a personal selection, the ones that helped me learn this library.
