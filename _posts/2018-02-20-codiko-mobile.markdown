Codiko is a web and mobile app to train for the driver's license theorical exam in France. It was initialy a project that had to be integrated to the existing online driving school website, PermiGo. However, regarding the size of the app we chose to create a stand-alone app. Therefor we chose to start the project with trending programming tools such as Ruby On Rails 5 (the final release was not yet out) and React.

Our development team on Codiko was pretty small so we had to focus on the web app and let a web agency handle the mobile version (for iOS and Android).

The first version of the web and mobile app was released in June 2016. We managed to release both at the same time but we quickly regreted the decision of not developping the mobile app on our own. Mistakes were made on the web app involving multiple updates of the API. Fixes on the mobile app weren't deploied as quickly as we wanted.

Codiko was my first experience in React and with Javascript frameworks. Therefore I was a little premature to be able to take the initiave of developping the app in React Native (RN wasn't even publicly released at that time).

A year after the release, we achieved to have a stable web app and API. We started looking for some improvements that we could bring to the app and started rethinking the mobile version to see if it would be a good idea to develop it from scratch with React Native.

The actual design of the app wasn't bad. We just wanted to change it since we wanted to change the app.

## The challenge



## How we tried to achieve it

## Results

Sadly we didn't manage to finish this project since the people working on it (including me) didn't pursue their adventure in the company and given the fact that this was a research project, it was not completed.

However we achieved to develop a prototype showcasing the potential of React Native and giving us a better overview of the technology and the time needed to have a running app.

## What we have learned

* Having a running web app with React is a real time saver in the development process of a React Native app. You can easily use the same code or maybe you'll just have to tweak it a little.

## Conclusion
