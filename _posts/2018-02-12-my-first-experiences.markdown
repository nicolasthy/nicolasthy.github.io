A long time has past since I've written for myself. 2017 has been a long year. School, work, friends, entertainment. So much has happened, but it's time to change some things and go trough 2018 with new goals.

My last day at school was at the beginning of the year, the 27th January. However I wasn't yet graduated. I had to write a paper and finish my internship. Graduation day was set in December. Spoiler alert, **I'm now an Engineer !** ðŸŽ‰
