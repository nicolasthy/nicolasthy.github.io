A long time has past since I've written for myself. 2017 has been a long year. School, work, friends, entertainment. So much has happened, but it's time to change some things and go trough 2018 with new goals.

My last day at school was at the beginning of the year, the 27th January. However I wasn't yet graduated. I had to write a paper and finish my internship. Graduation day was set in December. Spoiler alert, **I'm now and Engineer !** ðŸŽ‰


## Social First

*TLDR: I'm just going to write about my life here: travels, concerts, roommates, sports, ... You can skip to the job / tech part !*

Here I am, at the end of my Master degree, 5 years of hard work and on the verge of starting a new life as a developper. It was also the year I was going to turn 25, so I took the time to enjoy everything, meet new people, try new things and overhaul do whatever I am proposed to do. Yes, it sounds cheesy.

I did however still focus on learning new things and working on cool projects, but I'll get there later.
